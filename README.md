# mitoplotR
plot circular genomes with R and {circlize}

Simple function for plotting clear, pretty plots of circular genomes. You may need to tweak the heights and offsets at various points as well as the treatment of base coverage if it is very high in certain regions (default here is log-transform, and subtract a it). Take a look at the awesome doumentation to see how to add other tracks and bits of annotation.
