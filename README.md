plot circular genomes with R and {circlize}

Simple function for plotting clear, pretty plots of circular genomes. You may need to tweak the heights and offsets here and there, and work out what to do with coverage if it is very high in certain regions (default here is log-transform, and subtract a bit). Take a look at the awesome circlize doumentation to see how to customize with other tracks and bits of annotation.
